# Western Governors University C196 Mobile Application Development Project

This is a Android app developed in Android Studio. It's an app to allow students to track their term by adding terms,
courses, assessments and notes.  Terms contain courses, courses have assessments and students are able to add notes 
to both assessments and courses.  

The project was developed in Java, and uses SQLite for a local database.
